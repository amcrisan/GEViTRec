# Overview
GEVis is a proof-of-concept implementation of a technique for automatically generating views of statistically coordinated charts (a dashabord) from multiple heterogeneous data sources. This technique is optimized for applications in genomic epidemiology.

# Use
As a proof-of-concept, GEVis is sutiable only for experimental and research used. Anyone wishing to use GEVis on their own data accepts the code as is. We welcome feedback from the community and encourage users to submit problems or feature requests via the issues board in this repository.


## Examples of Use
Within the installation folder (/inst), we present the application of GEVis, using RMarkdown notebooks, on a synthetic and real world dataset of the 2014-2016 Ebola Outbreak.
